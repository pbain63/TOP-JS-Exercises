        The representation of an idea by a light bulb(<span class="bulb"
          >ðŸ’¡</span
        >) is a commonly used metaphor that symbolizes the moment of inspiration
        or the birth of a new idea. The association between a light bulb and an
        idea can be traced back to the invention of the incandescent light
        bulb(<span class="bulb">ðŸ’¡</span>) by Thomas Edison in the late 19th
        century. The light bulb is a powerful symbol because it represents
        illumination, clarity, and the sudden brightening of one's thoughts or
        understanding. When someone has an idea, it is often described as a
        light bulb turning on in their mind, signifying a moment of insight or
        creativity. The image of a light bulb also suggests the idea of energy,
        power, and the potential for growth and development.
